You are currently viewing the GitHub for my **MVC Movie Database Coding Project**. 

# MVC Movie Database Coding Project
The tutorial used to build this Coding Project was written by [Rick Anderson](https://twitter.com/RickAndMSFT). You can view the tutorial by clicking [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/start-mvc?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio). The tutorial taught me how to setup a ASP.NET Core MVC Project with Controllers and Views. I have learned the basics of building an ASP.NET Core MVC web application using Rick's tutorial. 

Using the tutorial I learned how to:

Create a web application.
Add and scaffold a model.
Work with a database.
Add search and validation. 

In the end, I was able to create a simple web application that allows the user to manage and display movie data.
